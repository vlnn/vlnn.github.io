** What's that
I'm reading a book, I'm taking notes. Here will be notes for the book "Art of Lisp Programing"

** What is Art of Lisp Programming
A 1987 book by Robin Jones and Ian Stewart, seems to be quite a primitive introduction to the LISP. Still, it's written pretty well, illustrated with pictures from Alice in Wonderland and is, well, interesting! Also authors are from ZX Spectrum clique, that is +100500 to their nerdiness.
** Try simple things
*** car/cdr are named so due to historical reasons, i.e. assembly mnemonics of long gone IBM 709. Let's use *head* and *tail* instead.
#+begin_src lisp :results value :wrap src results  :exports both
(defun head (x)
 (car x))
(defun tail (x)
  (cdr x))
(- (head '(4 3 2 1)) (head (tail '(4 3 2 1))))  ;; 1 is expected as (- 4 3)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src results
1
#+end_src
