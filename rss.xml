  <title><![CDATA[Daylight lamp: first day]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
I&rsquo;ve bought a daylight lamp and not sure about it.
</p>

<p>
The idea beside this product is that if human being has less daylight than usual due to bad weather or wrong lifestyle, they may use artificial light source with the spectrum of emission that is similar to natural sunlight. Moreover, it may be constructed in such a way, that no harmful UV radiation is created. And, of course, but companies decided that it&rsquo;s time to make a big buck selling cheap lamps. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m using Beurer TL 100 lamp. This is not a proper review or paid promotion. This is my first day impressions.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2d9b260" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2d9b260">First look</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2d9b260">

<figure id="org17fbea0">
<img src="static/daylight-lamp.gif" alt="daylight-lamp.gif">

</figure>

<p>
Big, round, milky white lamp needs constant connection to the power outlet. Using buttons on the unit you may switch it on/off and control brightness to some extent.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org04ce9aa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org04ce9aa">Another sun</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org04ce9aa">
<p>
Imagine you close the curtains and then go out of room. When you return to the room first you think that someone has opened the curtains and it&rsquo;s a sunny outside. Everything is illuminated with nice (and surprizingly cold &#x2013; meaning more to the blue side of spectrum) light. This is how the lamp is working. The picture doesn&rsquo;t present it too good, but it was pretty sunny even without the lamp switched on, but with the light from the lamp everything else looks like deep shadow. Also it&rsquo;s nice to have two sources of light that comes from different directions (there&rsquo;s even a specific pattern called &ldquo;Light on Two Sides of Every Room&rdquo; in a book &ldquo;A Pattern Language&rdquo; by Christopher Alexander).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5eabd5b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5eabd5b">Good</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5eabd5b">
<p>
Lots of things are better when illuminated. I like how everything looks under the daylight lamp. This made me a bit happier, of course, but not sure if it&rsquo;s antistress effect of shopping or lamp really works in this context.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7e4db69" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7e4db69">Bad</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e4db69">
<p>
My eyes seems to be a bit sore due to constant bright thingy in unusual place. I&rsquo;ve switched the lamp after 2-3 hours of test on it&rsquo;s lowest level.

A 1987 book by Robin Jones and Ian Stewart, seems to be quite a primitive introduction to the LISP. Still, it&rsquo;s written pretty well, illustrated with pictures from Alice in Wonderland and is, well, interesting! Also authors are from ZX Spectrum clique, that is +100500 to their nerdiness.

  <title><![CDATA[Configuration maintainance vs renovation]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
It&rsquo;s astonishing how much time it takes to support things that are already working. E.g. every upgrade of <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/">Doom Emacs</a> (which I <b>love</b> to use but hate to tinker with) is about several things at once:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Upgrade itself e.g. `doom upgrade` and fixing stuff if something goes wrong. It usually does need a bit of research to find out how to fix it. Would be nice to have `doom rollback` working, but it&rsquo;s impossible as of now.</li>
<li>Manually check if upgrade broke something: I use several different &ldquo;stacks&rdquo; in my setup, e.g. a bit of org, clojure, common lisp, C# from time to time, dictionaries, org agenda.
This is one of most time consuming and unpredictible part of the upgrade; it&rsquo;s not automated and I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s ever will be; you never sure everything is tested; you have to try it against your real work.</li>
<li>I have to formalize all the small &ldquo;current fixes&rdquo; of my configuration as commits or backups, which is too often becomes a batch of changes called &ldquo;system as of 2022&rdquo;. Good luck with understanding why exactly you put this strange line somewhere in the custom.el!</li>
</ol>

<p>
I like computers. I like programming computers. I don&rsquo;t like computers programming me. But real reason for this problem is wrong level of abstraction. It&rsquo;s something similar to docker images: you find a brittle shitty solution and put it under the clone machine so every time it breaks you just clone same brittle shitty solution. This is fun and techy, but this does not resolve the root of the problem: you had a shitty solution!
</p>

<p>
But what can we do about this burden of the maintainance? Could we pay someone else to do it (we do with gmail so we don&rsquo;t administer mail servers ourselves)? Could we make better automation for keeping the system in revertable state (we do it with making system images or dockers)? Could we just throw away the need that made us use the configurable software we have?
</p>

<p>
Sorry, I guess this is all wrong approaches, or rather they are all right approaches that are partly applicable. We will outsource lots of things to services, we will have better automation for backups, we will reduce the needs (like soldering your own PC) and get new ones (like, uhmmm, getting subscriptions for time without internet access). But this is not a solution. These are palliatives.
</p>

<p>
Renovation is my metaphor for creating life with similar, but better things around. You have your house, it has leaking tubes and small dirty windows: fix tubes, change floors, clean or change windows, call it a day. But <b>use</b> those tubes. <b>Look</b> through the windows. Noone is renovating their house just because they like to tinker around: there&rsquo;s always a more or less clear goal, when you will say &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done!&rdquo; or at least &ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of money!&rdquo;. I guess the metaphor is working &#x2013; you&rsquo;re either cleaning your floors every day from what shit that is leaking or you fix the tubes. Software tubes are leaking all the time, mind you: rss feeds become outdated, old programs that you&rsquo;re not even using keep charging you for the licenses, new computer can&rsquo;t open old formats etc. Don&rsquo;t use docker for this: own the problem, make it formal, write it down, add it to the todo list. And &#x2013; perhaps! &#x2013; there will be a precious time when you fix it and say: this is my emacs configuration which I hone since times immemorial and it still does things for me!
</p>

<h2 id="orge797848">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge797848">

<li>Try to find existing solutions, preferably old ones but currently supported.</li>

  <title><![CDATA[Привіт, чудовий світе (once again)]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
This is to declare that the stuff has been moved from <a href="https://vlnn.github.io">vlnn.github.io</a> to <a href="https://vlnn.dev/">vlnn.dev</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org60ac5eb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org60ac5eb">WHO:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org60ac5eb">
<p>
My name is Volodymyr Anokhin and this is my blog. You may know me as VLNN (mostly at <a href="https://github.com/vlnn">vlnn@github.com)</a>. I&rsquo;m Ukrainian and that&rsquo;s why instead of &ldquo;Hello, wonderful world&rdquo; you may see some Cyrillics in the title of this record.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4dcc324" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4dcc324">WHAT:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4dcc324">
<p>
This is another try to set up minimalistic mostly technical blog. I plan to write things about my current projects which are mostly software-related at the moment. I was working as a Radio Engineer, as an Engineering Manager, and now I am a software developer. Somehow I always have chosen less-popular programming languages, and so I was writing production code in J, FORTH and APL. Now I moved a bit to more conventional side of Clojure.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org77e899d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org77e899d">WHY:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org77e899d">
<p>
It&rsquo;s not my first try to set up a place to share some technical or not-that-technical stuff across the internet. But somehow all the &ldquo;social&rdquo; platforms tend to become a social burden, and &ldquo;technical&rdquo; platforms tend to become more social with time. So I want to create a small piece of the network here, with smaller auditory but much bigger calmness. I&rsquo;m not even sure that I will enable comments here!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd36bc9d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd36bc9d">WHEN:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd36bc9d">
<p>
It&rsquo;s a wartime, joint forces of russia and belorussia are attacking and occupying parts of Ukraine right now. Perhaps not the best time to start a blog! But it&rsquo;s creation is not related to less chances of russia to kill or torture me. This is directly related to my plans to make everything I have to do during the war: support Ukrainian army, spend money for Ukrainian goods, and also represent Ukraine in every possible way. We are here. Some of us are still alive. We&rsquo;re kicking.
</p>

<p>
And I&rsquo;ll never forgive russians for what they did.

  <title><![CDATA[SQL as the Data Analysis' Volapük]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Lately I&rsquo;ve started to work with <a href="https://druid.apache.org/">Apache Druid</a> that is &ldquo;real-time database to power modern analytics applications&rdquo;. This is great piece of software, being in it&rsquo;s late version 0.23.0, providing blazing-fast queries to your data. Surely enough, you always pay for the speed: sometimes with old good money (e.g. buy more resources from the powerhouses), sometimes with time needed to prepare the data for being queries (e.g. indexing), sometimes with absence of generality (e.g. make your highly intricate specific DB and go struggle when business needs something unsupported), sometimes just with your brainpower needed to understand and implement new stuff. At the moment, I think Druid is being paid mainly with two latter currencies.
</p>

<p>
So, having a bit of experience in Data warehouse project (5 years ago? eternity!), I was really interested how exactly the speed is being gained. If you&rsquo;re interested, please take a look at <a href="https://druid.apache.org/faq">this FAQ page</a> (spoiler: inverted indexes and intricate metadata model). This post is not about it. This post is about SQL that is currently being used as defacto standard for thinking about data &#x2013; even when &ldquo;real&rdquo; data is not stored in RDBMS.
</p>

<p>
As most of the industry-grade programming languages, SQL has lots of qualities from different areas: it&rsquo;s mainly declarative, but has procedural mechanisms. It&rsquo;s made for queries but creates databases and tables. It&rsquo;s based on relational algebra, but  It&rsquo;s structured but sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to find the structure behind 30 screens of the statement. At last, it has been designed for managers and now DB-team is usually sitting very far away from the commercial department. This is how evolution works, nothing unusual here.
</p>

<p>
But, being widely used, SQL get into the fields, where I was surprised to see it &#x2013; for instance in the NoSQL world. Check out how similar is Cassandra&rsquo;s CQL, even though Cassandra is famous NoSQL DB! Excel files <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/how-to/sql-queries-excel">could be used as SQL data bases</a>! Even very non-usual languages like Q are calling the some data-manipulating functions <a href="https://code.kx.com/q4m3/9_Queries_q-sql/">q-sql</a>, using different syntax, but at least partially sharing same mental model of the data manipulation.
</p>

<p>
This leads me to the point, at which I should make a bold statement: I don&rsquo;t think SQL is a good programming language. I mean, it&rsquo;s good, but it&rsquo;s not <b>that good</b>, it&rsquo;s not the default language when you write or think about the data. Its main feature is universality, sure; but being wide-spread across the industry, it effectively wipes out all the other possible ways of thinking around the data. It&rsquo;s liek bad english of the internetz: you want to say <b>I love you so much</b>, but sending 🔥🔥🔥 instead; you want to know who wrote the hit and writing
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sql"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> song_id <span style="font-weight: bold;">FROM</span> charts <span style="font-weight: bold;">FETCH</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIRST</span> <span style="color: #8a3b3c; font-weight: bold;">1</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">ROWS</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">ONLY</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
instead, panicking how long will become the join to the composers table. It&rsquo;s really similar to Volapük in many contexts: it&rsquo;s as artificial, it&rsquo;s designed to be widely used, it&rsquo;s good but not necessary best, and it may be scorched out with some new technology (Esperanto in Volapük&rsquo;s case). Not sure if I will see the dawn of SQL, but it could be a wonderful view!
