* Current projects:
** Tech-blog [[https://vlnn.dev/blog][VLNN writes]]
** Kinesis Advantage customized layout
I've tried to create a layout which is symmetrical and home-row driven. You may find it [[https://github.com/vlnn/kinesis-advantage-2][here]].
The project is mostly done for now, as I have no interest to support official firmware anymore, and QMK-stuff has been unchanged for months. Still, I plan to create MacOS version in future. Still it's being supported.
** Zesty
*VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE* I'm playing around with Clojure's ways of code generation, thus there's simple Z80 assembler written in Clojure.

* Cancelled or frozen projects
** TODO
