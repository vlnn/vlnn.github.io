<p>
Not that long time ago (or was it long time? 10 years ago or so?) Dropbox was the new kind of the services &#x2013; very simple, very cheap, very direct kind of service. You want to share the photo or your hipster todo.txt, you put it in a special folder and that&rsquo;s it: it will be delivered automatically to everybody whom you informed the link, or to every PC where Dropbox is running under your creds. That&rsquo;s it! Super easy, super cool!
</p>

<p>
I just used current version of Dropbox app for Android, and it is just terrifyingly awful. For starters, it has tutorial wizards that break my needs; I want to press a button, but it is covered with a text cloud of a tutorial. Next, I want to download some video files to my android device: there are buttons &ldquo;Sync&rdquo;, &ldquo;Make available offline&rdquo; and &ldquo;Save to Device&rdquo; &#x2013; and also &ldquo;Duplicate&rdquo;. Next, it asks to access my photos and my camera. And moreover, it shares the names of people who have access to the folder to anybody who has it already.
</p>

<p>
I can&rsquo;t even&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I understand Syncthing could be infuriatingly complex, but at least it does one thing, and does it good.

<p>
Some time ago I was a part of a team who introduced modern software development processes (text-based sources, CI, CD, cloud here and there) across the company with humongous and very cleverly written monolith. Yup, internally sources were not stored as text files. Yup, the format was created in-house. Yup, you had to use internal toolings only to work with this code. Yup, it was a great revelation for me to understand how different real work is from the world of js-hipsters deploying things over heroku.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly enough, the core of the my team was consisted of people who actually wrote the most clever parts. I was a part of this project for couple years trying my best and watching superheroes around me trying their best to finish this project. At some point I left the company and all I have now is this screenshot of one-week project of providing developers possibility to load customized tools into the work environment.

<p>
Two unsettling ideas arise in my brain after I share the picture above:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Software industry is expanding so fast that half of your colleagues perhaps have less than 5 years of experience (stole the idea from someone, but it&rsquo;s as unsettling as my one).</li>
<li>Some senior clever guys and girls right now are trying to help &rsquo;newcomers&rsquo; to work with legacy code bases they themeselves developed over the years. This task may be much harder than actually developing the legacy code base.</li>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve bought a daylight lamp and not sure about it.
</p>

<p>
The idea beside this product is that if human being has less daylight than usual due to bad weather or wrong lifestyle, they may use artificial light source with the spectrum of emission that is similar to natural sunlight. Moreover, it may be constructed in such a way, that no harmful UV radiation is created. And, of course, but companies decided that it&rsquo;s time to make a big buck selling cheap lamps. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m using Beurer TL 100 lamp. This is not a proper review or paid promotion. This is my first day impressions.
</p>

<p>
Big, round, milky white lamp needs constant connection to the power outlet. Using buttons on the unit you may switch it on/off and control brightness to some extent.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org04ce9aa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org04ce9aa">Another sun</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org04ce9aa">
<p>
Imagine you close the curtains and then go out of room. When you return to the room first you think that someone has opened the curtains and it&rsquo;s a sunny outside. Everything is illuminated with nice (and surprizingly cold &#x2013; meaning more to the blue side of spectrum) light. This is how the lamp is working. The picture doesn&rsquo;t present it too good, but it was pretty sunny even without the lamp switched on, but with the light from the lamp everything else looks like deep shadow. Also it&rsquo;s nice to have two sources of light that comes from different directions (there&rsquo;s even a specific pattern called &ldquo;Light on Two Sides of Every Room&rdquo; in a book &ldquo;A Pattern Language&rdquo; by Christopher Alexander).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5eabd5b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5eabd5b">Good</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5eabd5b">
<p>
Lots of things are better when illuminated. I like how everything looks under the daylight lamp. This made me a bit happier, of course, but not sure if it&rsquo;s antistress effect of shopping or lamp really works in this context.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7e4db69" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7e4db69">Bad</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e4db69">
<p>
My eyes seems to be a bit sore due to constant bright thingy in unusual place. I&rsquo;ve switched the lamp after 2-3 hours of test on it&rsquo;s lowest level.

A 1987 book by Robin Jones and Ian Stewart, seems to be quite a primitive introduction to the LISP. Still, it&rsquo;s written pretty well, illustrated with pictures from Alice in Wonderland and is, well, interesting! Also authors are from ZX Spectrum clique, that is +100500 to their nerdiness.

<p>
It&rsquo;s astonishing how much time it takes to support things that are already working. E.g. every upgrade of <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/">Doom Emacs</a> (which I <b>love</b> to use but hate to tinker with) is about several things at once:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Upgrade itself e.g. <code>doom upgrade</code> and fixing stuff if something goes wrong. It usually does need a bit of research to find out how to fix it. Would be nice to have <code>doom rollback</code> working, but it&rsquo;s impossible as of now.</li>
<li>Manually check if upgrade broke something: I use several different &ldquo;stacks&rdquo; in my setup, e.g. a bit of org, clojure, common lisp, C# from time to time, dictionaries, org agenda.
This is one of most time consuming and unpredictible part of the upgrade; it&rsquo;s not automated and I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s ever will be; you never sure everything is tested; you have to try it against your real work.</li>
<li>I have to formalize all the small &ldquo;current fixes&rdquo; of my configuration as commits or backups, which is too often becomes a batch of changes called &ldquo;system as of 2022&rdquo;. Good luck with understanding why exactly you put this strange line somewhere in the custom.el!</li>
</ol>

<p>
I like computers. I like programming computers. I don&rsquo;t like computers programming me. But real reason for this problem is wrong level of abstraction. It&rsquo;s something similar to docker images: you find a brittle shitty solution and put it under the clone machine so every time it breaks you just clone same brittle shitty solution. This is fun and techy, but this does not resolve the root of the problem: you had a shitty solution!
</p>

<p>
But what can we do about this burden of the maintainance? Could we pay someone else to do it (we do with gmail so we don&rsquo;t administer mail servers ourselves)? Could we make better automation for keeping the system in revertable state (we do it with making system images or dockers)? Could we just throw away the need that made us use the configurable software we have?
</p>

<p>
Sorry, I guess this is all wrong approaches, or rather they are all right approaches that are partly applicable. We will outsource lots of things to services, we will have better automation for backups, we will reduce the needs (like soldering your own PC) and get new ones (like, uhmmm, getting subscriptions for time without internet access). But this is not a solution. These are palliatives.
</p>

<p>
Renovation is my metaphor for creating life with similar, but better things around. You have your house, it has leaking tubes and small dirty windows: fix tubes, change floors, clean or change windows, call it a day. But <b>use</b> those tubes. <b>Look</b> through the windows. Noone is renovating their house just because they like to tinker around: there&rsquo;s always a more or less clear goal, when you will say &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done!&rdquo; or at least &ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of money!&rdquo;. I guess the metaphor is working &#x2013; you&rsquo;re either cleaning your floors every day from what shit that is leaking or you fix the tubes. Software tubes are leaking all the time, mind you: rss feeds become outdated, old programs that you&rsquo;re not even using keep charging you for the licenses, new computer can&rsquo;t open old formats etc. Don&rsquo;t use docker for this: own the problem, make it formal, write it down, add it to the todo list. And &#x2013; perhaps! &#x2013; there will be a precious time when you fix it and say: this is my emacs configuration which I hone since times immemorial and it still does things for me!
